# Memory Game Project

## About this game/project

With some starter code (HTML, CSS) and instruction (JS) provided, this project asked that a working memory game be created.

## Instructions

Basically, when a card is clicked, it's symbol is shown. When a second it clicked, that symbol shows, and the timer then starts (I wanted it to start after the second card was clicked). If they match, they stay 'face up', change color, and one turn is recorded as a 'move'. If they don't match, they both flip back over after just under a second, one turn is recorded and shown as a 'move', and the game continues until all cards match.

While the game is going, the timer is counting up showing the time taken to play the current round. After 10 turns are recorded, one of the three stars is removed. After another 10, a second is removed. The third stays regardless of the move count.

Once the game is completed, a box comes up indicating the user won, provides a star ranking, time it took, moves taken, and an 'Again?' reset button.
